# Housing-Predictions-Using-ML-Models
Housing prediction is a classic problem in machine learning that involves predicting the prices of houses based on various features. 
In this project, I have used clustering algorithms such as Kmeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering to group similar houses together based on their features. We will also use linear and logistic regression models to predict the prices of these houses based on their features.

Methodology:
The following steps will be followed to carry out housing prediction using clustering and regression:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be preprocessed by removing any missing values, scaling the features, and encoding categorical features if any.
Clustering: Kmeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering algorithms will be used to cluster the houses based on their features. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using techniques such as the elbow method, silhouette score, and dendrogram visualization.

Regression: Linear and logistic regression models will be trained on the clustered data to predict the prices of the houses based on their features. The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the clustering algorithms and regression models will be evaluated based on their accuracy and interpretability. The results will be compared, and the most suitable algorithm will be chosen.

Expected Outcomes:
The project is expected to cluster similar houses together based on their features, allowing us to gain insights into the housing market. This information can be useful for real estate agents and investors in making informed decisions. Additionally, the regression models are expected to predict the prices of houses accurately based on their features.

Conclusion:
The proposed project involves using clustering algorithms and regression models to predict housing prices based on various features. The project has real-world applications in the real estate industry and can be used to make informed decisions. The results of the clustering algorithms and regression models can be visualized and analyzed to gain insights into the housing market.
